This Quartz Composer plug-in provides some JSON helper.

This plug-in was developed for BoinxTV. When Twitter stopped supporting the 1.0 API and only JSON was supported.

The plug-in offer two patches:

JSON Importer
A JSON replacement for the XML Importer

JSON Streaming
This patch offers a permanent connection to a server.
Currently only twitter with delimiter=length is supported.


The plug-in is designed not to use any private (Quartz Composer) API. So the plug-in can be bundled with an app that is shipped through the Apple App Store.
