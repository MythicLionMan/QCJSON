This Quartz Composer plug-in provides some JSON helper.

This plugin was developed for BoinxTV. When Twitter stopped supporting the 1.0 API a only JSON was supported.

The plug-in is designed not to use any private (Quartz Composer) API. So the plug-in can be bundled with an app that is shipped through the Apple App Store.
